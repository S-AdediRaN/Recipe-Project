            <h2>Before you cook Jollof Rice</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the tomato stew. Visit the Tomato Stew page for details on how to do that. 
                    It is advisable to prepare tomato stew before hand and keep in the freezer. 
                    This is so that whenever you want to cook any jollof rice related dish, 
                    it is just a matter of adding it to your cooking.</li><br>
                <li>If you will use whole chicken then wash and cut it into pieces. 
                    Cook with the thyme, Knorr cubes and 2 bulbs of onions (chopped). 
                    The cooking time depends on the type of chicken. 
                    The rooster or cockerel cooks much faster than the hen but the hen is definitely tastier.
                    When done, grill it in an oven. You may also fry it. This is to give it a golden 
                    look which is more presentable especially if you have guests for dinner.</li><br>
                <li>Parboil the rice using the method detailed in parboiling rice for cooking jollof rice.
                    Rinse the parboiled rice and put in a sieve to drain.</li><br>

            <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour the chicken stock and the tomato stew into a sizeable pot and leave to boil.</li><br>
                <li>Add the drained parboiled rice, curry powder, salt and pepper to taste. 
                    The water level should be the same level of the rice. 
                    This is to ensure that all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked.</li><br>
                <li>Cover the pot and leave to cook on low to medium heat. 
                    This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up.</li><br>
            </ol>
            <p>If you parboiled the rice as described at parboiling rice for cooking jollof rice,
            the rice should be done by the time the water is dry. Taste to confirm. 
            If not, you will need to add more water and reduce the heat to prevent burning.
            Keep cooking till done.</p>

            <h3> Nutrition</h3>
        </div>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cooked, unenriched, white, long-grained rice is composed of 68% water, 28% carbohydrates, 
                3% protein and negligible fat (table). In a 100 gram serving, it provides 130 calories and contains 
                no micronutrients in significant amounts, with all less than 10% of the Daily Value (DV) (table). 
                Cooked, white, short-grained rice also provides 130 calories and contains moderate amounts of B vitamins, 
                Iron, and manganese   (10–17% DV) per 100-amount (table). A detailed analysis of nutrient content 
                of rice suggests that the nutrition value of rice varies based on a number of factors. It depends 
                on the strain of rice, that is between White, Brown, Red, and Black (or purple) varieties of rice 
                – each prevalent in different parts of the world. It also depends on the nutrient quality of the 
                soil rice is grown in, whether and how the rice is polished or processed, the manner it is enriched, 
                and how it is prepared before consumption. Rice is the staple food of over half the world’s population. 
                It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North 
                and South America and 8 countries in Africa. Rice provides 20% of the world’s dietary energy supply, while 
                wheat supplies 19% and maize (corn) 5%.</p><hr>
